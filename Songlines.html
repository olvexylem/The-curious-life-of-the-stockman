                    A SONGLINE, also called dreaming track, is one of the paths across the land 
                    (or sometimes the sky) within the animist belief systems of the Aboriginal 
                    cultures of Australia. They mark the route followed by localised “creator-beings” 
                    in the Dreaming*. These routes serve as crucial connections between individuals 
                    and their ancestral lands, carrying intricate geographical, mythological, and 
                    cultural information.

                    Songlines are both ancient and contemporary. They trace the journey of ancestral beings 
                    and how things came to be. They are songs and stories of events and navigational routes 
                    through Country. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander songs have told the stories of the land as it 
                    changed over thousands of years, transforming into ranges, rivers and water holes. 
                    They have sung into being people's culture and their connection to country as a living thing.
                    Songs like the Nyamal song, performed by Topsy Fazeldine about the Pilbara steam train that ran 
                    between Marble Bar and Port Hedland between 1911 and 1951, connect recent histories and experiences 
                    to ancient song styles.

                    The Nyamal train song is known as a Japi song, a public song that was composed by <i>Pilbara stockman</i> 
                    <b>Mangkayipirti</b> or <b>Larry Brown</b>. It tells of the sights and sounds of the train’s journey through Nyamal 
                    country.

                    Larry Brown, whose Aboriginal name is Mangkayipirti, was born toward the end of the nineteenth century, 
                    around 1895, near Mulyie pastoral station. Mulyie was one of the earliest sheep stations in the Pilbara, 
                    situated on the De Grey River. Larry Brown was one of the early generations of pastoral workers in 
                    the area and worked as a stockman on or near Mulyie until his death in 1950. He was buried one mile 
                    from Mulyie station homestead. Larry’s Paddock at Mulyie is believed to be named after him.

                    Topsy Fazeldine was born in 1922 near Mulyie pastoral station. She worked as a domestic and stock camp 
                    assistant at Mulyie station and stations along the De Grey River and train line. In about 1946 she joined 
                    the Pilbara pastoral strikers at Twelve Mile camp outside Port Hedland and travelled with them to the tin 
                    mining enterprise at Moolyella. She worked on stations occasionally through the 1960s, but was mostly 
                    travelling with her husband Mick Fazeldine through towns and various camps from Port Hedland to Marble Bar. 
                    Topsy Fazeldine died in 1991.

                    The Train Song is about a recent event. It is also inextricably linked to community life, language and 
                    country and the long histories of Aboriginal people in the Pilbara. To sing this Japi song is to sing a 
                    journey through country. Calling the country place by place brings it back to life and ensures it continues. 
                    Mangkayipirti created a song that told of the journey through his country singing and calling the Nyamal 
                    names of hills, waterholes and places of significance. He passed this song to his daughter Topsy Fazeldine, 
                    who recreates the journey through the song and keeps her culture alive.

                    The recording of the Nyamal train song was archived at AIATSIS. Fifty years later in 2014, Topsy’s son 
                    Basil Snook and Elders from the Nyamal community heard the old recording of the train song and began 
                    their own journey of finding the old train tracks. They translated the song into English and put it 
                    into film and an exhibition to share it with everyone, especially young Aboriginal people of the Pilbara.

                    The Nyamal train song is a Japi song composed by an individual about everyday things 
                    that were witnessed or experienced in recent times. Japi songs are public songs for anyone to listen to. 
                    They are also known in the Pilbara as Nyirlpu and Yirraru. Japi songs are often about travelling, and the 
                    experiences of riding, seeing and hearing machines like trains, planes, trucks and boats, and even a 
                    washing machine.

                        Japi songs are often accompanied by rhythmic scraping sounds created by rubbing a hard instrument 
                        like a rock or coin across a rough surface. Some singers created special wooden instruments by cutting 
                        notches into a boomerang or solid piece of wood and rubbing a thinner stick along it.

                SONGS are important for transmitting cultural an historical information, encoding knowledge of genealogies and stories, 
                records of ancestors and kinships, knowledge of the universe and the land, medicinal culinary knowledge, social norms,
